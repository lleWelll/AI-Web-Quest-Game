# AI Web Quest Game
AI Web Quest Game is an interactive web application where players create and explore text-based adventures generated by ChatGPT-4o.
The story is not prewritten â€” it is built dynamically, starting from any sentence the player submits. The AI uses the player's input to craft a unique quest, offering different scenarios and choices at each step.

Players can register, log in. The application uses Spring Boot as a backend framework, Thymeleaf for rendering HTML pages, and MySQL database for saving user's stories.
Security is managed through Spring Security, ensuring protected access to the game content.

## Features
- User registration and authentication with custom login form (Spring security)
- AI-generated quests based on player input (OpenAI, 4o model)
- Saving player progress in the database (MySQL)
